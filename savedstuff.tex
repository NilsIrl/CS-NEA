In order to test the software and validate the success criteria in an objective
way, a testing script \texttt{neasuccess} will be written before the
implementation has started to be written. This test script will run the
implementation with different inputs and verify that the output is the one
expected.

The success test script will be modular and be able to support many different
tests. It will work in the following way: In the \texttt{tests} directory,
there will be files with the extension \texttt{.input} and \texttt{.output}.
The success test script will run the interpreter with as input the content of
the \texttt{.input} files and check if the output is the same as the file with
the same basename but as extension \texttt{.output} file.

An argument can be given to the success test script to only use the tests with
the basename given.

The following success criteria are derived from the pseudocode guide in
\textcite{h446}. They are ordered such that later tests can include features
from previous tests. Due to the nature of a programming language, it is very
possible that some of these features will all be implemented at once,
especially considering some features are really built-in functions more than
anything else and as such may not require to be core language features.
